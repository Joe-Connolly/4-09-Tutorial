![](http://i.giphy.com/eUh8NINbZf9Ys.gif)

Brief motivation here as well as in presentation

## Overview

We're going to show you how to quickly put together a website with basic components using the component library Bootstrap. After completing this tutorial, you should have a working, locally hosted website withâ€¦
* A Nav Bar
* Jumbotrons
* Buttons
* Column based text
* A carousel of images
* Responsive design
* Minor customization


## Part 1: Setup + Creating a Locally Hosted Webpage

Create a new folder. Locate that folder, and create empty HTML and CSS files in it using your text editor or the command line:
```
touch index.html styles.css
```
Open these files in a text editor. Just like Short Assignment 1, fill ```index.html``` with some basic HTML content.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>
       <title>Bootstrap Demo</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
   </body>
</html>
```
Next, locally test the mini web page you just created.
For Python 2:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

For Python 3:
```
python -m http.server
```


## Step by Step

* Explanations of the what **and** the why behind each step. Try to include:
  * higher level concepts
  * best practices

Remember to explain any notation you are using.

```javascript
/* and use code blocks for any code! */
```
